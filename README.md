# SPS-P generated by C++
This is the static site generator for experiments of SPS-P model simulation. You can simulate it with arbitrary options.

The results are hosted on firebase.

## Usage
There are 2 binaries `generator` and `generator-p` which is in an open boundary and a periodic boundary respectively.
```
$ make && ./generator-p [options]
```

## Options
```
$ ./generator-p [ -k1 k00 k01 k10 k11 ] [ -k2 ka kb kp km ] [ -init random/zero ]
[ -gen number ] [ -cycle number ] [ -seed number ]
[ -dynamic none/global-static-discrete/global-dynamic-discrete/local-static-discrete/local-dynamic-discrete/local-static-continuous/local-dynamic-continuous]
[ -path_html string ] [ -path_proto string ] [ -p1 double ] [ -p2 double ]

-k1        K paramters. k01 means the degree how the type 0 particle likes the type 1 particle.
-k2        K paramters. k00=ka, k01=kp+km, k10=kp-km, and k11=kb.
  e.g. N=50
  kij = {
    ka (1<=i<=25, 1<=j<=25)
    kp + km (1<=i<=25, 26<=j<=50)
    kp - km (26<=i<=50, 1<=j<=25)
    kb (26<=i<=50, 26<=j<=50)
  }
-init      The initial state for all particles. -init random indicates that all particles starts with a random K parameter. -init zero indicates that all particles starts with 0.
-gen       The number of maximum steps.
-cycle     The length of periodic boundary. It is useless for open boundary.
-seed      The seed number to be used for generating random number. Default value is 1.
-dynamic   The flag to change the K parameters dinamically based on static energy/dynamic energy/local static energy. K params are not updated if you omit thid flag.
-path_html The path directory for a html file.
-path_json The path directory for a protocol buffer binary.
-p1        The probability of noise for updateing K params.
-p2        The probability of noise for updateing paricle's positions.
```

## Utils
- main.py: Combine the following functions in one file so you can save your time opening a json file.
  - usage: main.py [-h] -src SRC -out OUT
- stackplot.py: Generate an image from a json file. It is used for K parameters.
  - usage: stackplot.py [-h] -src SRC -out OUT
- logplot.py: Generate an image from a json file. It is used for static energy and dynamic energy.
  - usage: logplot.py [-h] -src SRC -out OUT
- loglogplot.py: Generate an image from a json file. It is used for X and V.
  - usage: loglogplot.py [-h] -src SRC -out OUT
- clustering.py: Generate an image from a json file. It divides all points to a cluster.
  - usage: clustering.py [-h] -src SRC -out OUT
